# L-I-A-M-Countdown-Clock
Countdown clock for events --
Created this countdown clock for a work friend's son who has SEN and struggles to understand time.  Ingeniously they used a stack of seven Lego bricks to represent a week but, need something more accurate.

# How to use
Download the Final_Code folder and contents
Open the event_time text file
Set the date, month, hour and minutes to your required time
Open the main LIAM_Clock program and run
The program will display a countdown - updates every minutes
Since the time is calculated in real time you can turn device / computer / Pi off and the time is recalculated next time you power up.
(Time can be set for a future date, up to 7 days)
