# L-I-A-M-Countdown-Clock
_Countdown clock for events_

Created this countdown clock for a work friend's son who has SEN and struggles to understand time.  Ingeniously they used a stack of seven Lego bricks to represent a week but, need something more accurate.

2. Open the event_time text file
3. Set the date, month, hour and minutes to your required time
